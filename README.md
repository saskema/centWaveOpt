## centWaveOpt
This script is part of the supplementary material for the paper "Automated Optimization of XCMS Parameters for Improved Peak Picking of LC-MS Data using the Coefficient of Variation and Parameter Sweeping for Untargeted Metabolomic" by Sascha K. Manier et al., Drug Testing and Analysis, 2018.
Use it to initially optimise for your peak XCMS parameters. In a first step the parameters will be used in a certain range and replace the XCMS-Online Q-Exactive preset parameters (Tautenhahn et al., Anal Chem., 2012) one by one. In a second step the top three parameters (except prefilter 1 and 2) will be combined in every possible way and the above described process will be repeated to exclude cross effects.

## How to use it
Place your XCMS readable files in a folder called "QC" and place it in your working directory. Specify your file ending in the beginning of the script and run it. The script will create a folder in your working directory called "centWaveOptResults" where it will save all the parameter sweeping results in CSV files.
After you obtained the CSV files open each and choose those XCMS parameters that led to the second lowest median coefficient of variation. If this applies to several parameters use that one which included more features (e.g. lowest minimum peakwidth, highest maximum peakwidth).

__There is now a "devel" branch that contains a modified version of this script in order to evluate each results table automatically. However, this will not be merged into the master branch to preserve the script as it was used in the corresponding publication.__

## Dependencies
This script requires tidyverse and XCMS. If not installed you can use the following lines to install them:

	install.packages('tidyverse')
	source('https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
	biocLite('xcms')

## Recommendation
Opening each and every CSV file is somewhat cumbersome and time consuming. However during the course of the research this made sense for me since I needed to see the results in detail. If someone uses this for his own research he is suggested to condense the results into one text file containing only the necessary parameters. Since this is the supplementary data to the above mentioned publication I will keep this file at the state when the paper was created.
